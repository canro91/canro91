<h1>Hola 👋, I'm Cesar</h1>
<h3>A software engineer, lifelong learner, language enthusiast and vivid reader</h3>

I'm passionate about programming and learning. I share my learning on my journey as a software engineer through [my blog](https://canro91.github.io/about/). In my free time, I like to read books _(on paper)_ and learn and teach foreign languages.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as C# back-end engineer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript/React and 🇧🇷 Brazilian Portuguese
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on C#, Python or Go open source projects
- 💬 Ask me about C#, language learning or anything else. I don't have all answers, tho
- ⚡ Fun fact: cat owner, vim user, plain-text lover and Zettelkasten practitioner
