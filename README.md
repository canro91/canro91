<h1>Hola 👋, I'm Cesar Aguirre</h1>
<h3>A software engineer, lifelong learner, language enthusiast and avid reader</h3>

I’m a software engineer based in Colombia 🇨🇴 _(not Columbia)_. I help teams to grow high-quality code. And by high-quality, I mean maintainable and performant.
  
I share my learning on my journey as a software engineer through [my blog](https://canro91.github.io/about/). I write about programming and learning in general. In my free time, I like to read 📚 books _(on paper)_ and learn and teach 🗣️ foreign languages.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as C# backend engineer and technical writer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript/React and 🇧🇷 Brazilian Portuguese
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on C#, Python or Go open source projects
- 💬 Ask me about C#, language learning or anything else. I don't have all answers, tho
