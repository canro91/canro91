<h1>Hola ðŸ‘‹, I'm Cesar</h1>
<h3>A software engineer, lifelong learner, language enthusiast and vivid reader</h3>

I'm passionate about programming and learning. I share my learning on my journey as a software engineer through [my blog](https://canro91.github.io/about/). In my free time, I like to read books _(on paper)_ and learn and teach foreign languages.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as C# back-end engineer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript/React and ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Brazilian Portuguese
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on C#, Python or Go open source projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about C#, language learning or anything else. I don't have all answers, tho
